Stone-Paper-Scissors Game in C
Welcome to the Stone-Paper-Scissors game repository! This project is an implementation of the classic hand game, brought to life using the C programming language. Designed with simplicity and efficiency, the game provides an interactive experience where players can compete against the computer in a series of rounds, testing their strategy and luck.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: The game allows users to input their choice (Stone, Paper, or Scissors) and pits them against the computer, which randomly generates its move.
Randomized Computer Moves: Using the rand() function, the computer's decisions are truly unpredictable, adding excitement and fairness to the game.
Result Calculation: The program compares the player's choice with the computer's and determines the winner based on the well-known rules:
Stone crushes Scissors
Scissors cut Paper
Paper covers Stone
Score Tracking: Keeps track of both the player’s and the computer’s scores, offering a competitive edge.
Replay Option: Users can replay the game as many times as they want without restarting the program.
Input Validation: Ensures only valid inputs are accepted, preventing crashes or incorrect behavior.
Code Highlights
Modular Design: The program is broken down into functions for better readability, reusability, and maintainability.
Beginner-Friendly: The code includes detailed comments explaining each step, making it a valuable resource for those new to C programming.
Core Concepts Demonstrated:
Conditional statements (if-else) to handle game logic.
Loops (while or do-while) for repetitive gameplay.
Random number generation with rand() for computer moves.
Input handling and validation for robustness.
How to Run
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Compile the code using any C compiler (e.g., GCC, Turbo C). Example for GCC:
bash
Copy
Edit
gcc sps_game.c -o sps_game
./sps_game
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
Future Enhancements
This project serves as an excellent starting point for further development. Here are some potential upgrades:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implement a GUI using libraries like SDL or GTK to enhance user interaction.
Multiplayer Mode: Add a two-player mode where users can play against each other.
Difficulty Levels: Introduce various difficulty levels by tweaking the computer's decision-making logic.
Customization: Allow users to modify game settings like the number of rounds or custom rules.
Online Multiplayer: Enable players to compete over a network using sockets programming.
Who Should Use This Project
This project is ideal for:

Beginners looking to practice C programming and understand foundational concepts like functions, loops, and conditionals.
Students who want a practical and fun project for learning randomization and user input handling.
Developers seeking a lightweight project to expand upon or experiment with.
